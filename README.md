# RobloxCSS
 Changes the look of the Roblox website

#### HOW TO USE
1. Install an extension such as [ABC JS-CSS Injector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/abc-js-css-injector/dnoagfebjndkhkabjkkoeeijnjpmbimj/related), though any CSS injector can be used
2. Open the extension
3. Copy the CSS from [here](styles.css) when prompted
4. Might work

## Future Plans
In the future, I plan to add support for Light Mode, though that would likely require a rewite of the pro amogus sussy developer code
